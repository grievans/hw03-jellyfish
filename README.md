This is a procedural animation of a jellyfish made using Houdini. It consists of several components: the main bell shape (revolving a curve about an axis, with the curvature varying over time, and having veins on its surface created by shortest path finding), internal organs (sweeping over noise-deformed arcs), arms (helix shapes with physical simulation using Vellum), and tentacles (using Vellum Hair).
